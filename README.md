# GTC-Building-100-Navigation
This program takes two different rooms or entrance/exits of Building 100 at Gwinnett Technical College and prints directions from Point A to Point B

12/1/2022
Currently, the program supports navigation between all exits and a very small number of rooms. Functionality for most rooms is not yet supported.
The program includes changes in direction (Turn Left, Turn Right, Continue Straight) through the User class.
For each room. the program provides directions to/from the closest Node (Hall Intersection or Building Exit), next update will include additional information about the 
exact room(on the left, on the right) as well as improvements that will prevent the program from pointing to a node that will result in the user passing their destination.
